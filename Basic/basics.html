          <p>HTML5 is the latest evolution of the standard that defines HTML. The term represents two different concepts. <br> 
             It is a new version of the language HTML, with new elements, attributes, and behaviors, and a larger set of technologies that allows 
             the building of more diverse and powerful Web sites and applications. <br> This set is sometimes called HTML5 & friends and often shortened to just HTML5.</p>

          <p>Designed to be usable by all Open Web developers, this reference page links to numerous resources about HTML5 technologies, <br>
            classified into several groups based on their function.</p>
          <ol>             
            <li>Semantics: allowing you to describe more precisely what your content is.</li>
            <li>Connectivity: allowing you to communicate with the server in new and innovative ways.</li>
            <li>Multimedia: making video and audio first-class citizens in the Open Web.</li>
            <li>Device access: allowing for the usage of various input and output devices.</li>
            <li>Styling: letting authors write more sophisticated themes.</li>
          </ol>

          <h1>CSS3</h1>
          <h2>An overview</h1>
          <p>CSS3 is the latest evolution of the Cascading Style Sheets language and aims at extending CSS2.1. It brings a lot of long-awaited novelties, like rounded corners, shadows, gradients, transitions or animations, as well as new layouts like multi-columns, flexible box or grid layouts. Experimental parts are vendor-prefixed and should either be avoided in production environments, or used with extreme caution as both their syntax and semantics can change in the future.</p>
          <h3>CSS Example:</h3>

            body {<br>
              background-color: lightblue;<br>
            }<br>

              color: white;<br>
              text-align: center;<br>
            }<br>
